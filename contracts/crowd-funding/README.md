# Crowd Funding

### Algorithm
* Admin starts campaign with specific monetary goal and deadline
* Admin has to create a Spending Request to spend money for the campaign
* Once request is created, Contributors can vote for that request
* Admin only has permission to spend if over 50% of Contributors support the request
* Contributors can request a refund if monetary goal was not reached by deadline
